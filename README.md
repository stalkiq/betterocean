# BetterOcean UI Scaffold

Standalone static scaffold that mirrors the requested three-pane command UI:

- Left icon rail with hollow buttons
- Left assets menu
- Center workspace with tabs and assets table
- Right assistant chat panel

## Run locally

Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or serve it with any static server.

## Notes

- This repo is intentionally independent from other projects.
- Rail buttons open blank tabs in the center workspace.
- Left menu remains interactive and updates the active subview label.
